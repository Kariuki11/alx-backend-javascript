### Understanding Node.js Basics

**Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side. Traditionally, JavaScript was used only in the browser, but Node.js extends its usage to server-side development, allowing JavaScript to be used for full-stack development.

#### Key Concepts in Node.js:
1. **V8 Engine**: 
   - Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same one used by Google Chrome, to run JavaScript on the server. The V8 engine converts JavaScript code into efficient machine code.

2. **Non-blocking, Asynchronous Nature**:
   - Node.js operates on a non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This means that I/O operations (like reading a file or querying a database) don't block the execution of code. Instead of waiting for these operations to complete, Node.js moves on to other tasks and handles the I/O operation in the background.

3. **Single-threaded**:
   - Despite being non-blocking, Node.js operates on a single thread. It handles multiple operations concurrently using an event loop, but this is all managed within one thread.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Node.js is built around an event loop, which listens for and responds to events. When an event occurs, Node.js picks the appropriate callback function and executes it.

5. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**:
   - NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to easily install and manage libraries and dependencies. It is a massive ecosystem of open-source JavaScript libraries.

6. **Modules**:
   - Node.js uses a modular system. You can split your code into multiple files and use the `require()` function to include them in your project. This helps to keep the code organized and reusable.

7. **File System Module**:
   - The `fs` module in Node.js allows you to interact with the file system, read files, write files, and much more.

8. **HTTP Module**:
   - Node.js comes with a built-in HTTP module that allows you to create an HTTP server, handle requests, and send responses.

9. **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**:
   - Node.js comes with a REPL console where you can execute JavaScript commands, inspect variables, and test out quick code snippets in an interactive shell.

10. **Error Handling**:
   - Handling errors properly in Node.js is crucial, especially in asynchronous functions. Promises, async/await, and callback functions are typically used for this purpose.

#### Basic Code Example
Here's a basic example of creating a simple web server using Node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

const port = 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

This code creates an HTTP server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" to every request.

### Key Areas to Understand for Node.js Basics:
- **Understanding of JavaScript fundamentals** (e.g., closures, callbacks, async/await)
- **How the Node.js event loop works** and its asynchronous nature
- **The role of `require()` and `module.exports`** for importing and exporting modules
- **Creating a basic server with the HTTP module**
- **Using NPM to manage packages and dependencies**
- **Interacting with the file system using the `fs` module**
- **Basic error handling with try-catch, callbacks, or promises**

### Possible Interview Questions on Node.js Basics:

1. **What is Node.js, and why is it used?**
   - Explanation: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run server-side, and it is used for its non-blocking, asynchronous behavior and fast performance.

2. **What is the difference between Node.js and a web browser's JavaScript?**
   - Explanation: While both run JavaScript, Node.js runs on the server side using the V8 engine, while browser JavaScript runs on the client side.

3. **Explain the Node.js event loop.**
   - Explanation: The event loop is a mechanism in Node.js that allows non-blocking I/O operations by handling multiple operations concurrently in a single thread.

4. **What is NPM, and why is it useful?**
   - Explanation: NPM is the package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to install and manage project dependencies.

5. **What is the difference between `require()` and `import` in Node.js?**
   - Explanation: `require()` is used in CommonJS modules (the traditional Node.js module system), while `import` is used in ECMAScript (ES) modules.

6. **How do you handle asynchronous operations in Node.js?**
   - Explanation: Asynchronous operations can be handled using callbacks, promises, or async/await.

7. **How do you read a file in Node.js?**
   - Possible Answer:
     ```javascript
     const fs = require('fs');
     fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
       if (err) throw err;
       console.log(data);
     });
     ```

8. **What is the `fs` module in Node.js?**
   - Explanation: The `fs` module allows you to interact with the file system, such as reading or writing files.

9. **How would you create a simple web server in Node.js?**
   - Explanation: This can be done using the `http` module by creating a server and listening to incoming requests.

10. **What are streams in Node.js, and why are they useful?**
    - Explanation: Streams are objects that allow you to read or write data in chunks instead of all at once, making them efficient for handling large files.

11. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous methods in Node.js?**
    - Explanation: Synchronous methods block the execution of code until a task is completed, while asynchronous methods allow the code to continue running while the task is being completed in the background.

These foundational concepts will help you better understand and work with Node.js.
